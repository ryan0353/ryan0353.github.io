            <p>As previously mentioned, my name is Maya Ryan. 
            I’m coming from Chicago, Illinois for school.
             I’ve been coding (with gaps) since about 7<sup>th</sup> grade.
              I have two cats that <em>unfortunately</em> are still in Chicago. 
              Their names are Celery and Ranch. I originally started in the game development program, but switched to this program as I thought it’d be more versatile.
               I’ve been enjoying my time in the program so far!
            </p>
    
            <p>I grew up with two older sisters. I was the baby until we got our dog,
             who’s now turning nine this year. My sisters and I have a significant age gap, 
             five and eight years. My oldest sister is living in New York City now and has
              been living there for about seven years.
               She was actually the one to send me the camera I needed for this program, 
               as she was trying to get rid of hers anyway!
               I’m excited to see what else is to come for this program, and how the classes are going to start mixing content once we start using <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
            </p>
